## Notes Web App

### General Info
I tried all of the listed commands menioned in document with instruction for *hometask #1 | Javascript*

* Saw commit log 
* Saw diff between commits
* Made some code changes and then saw git status
* Performed reset --hard

### Further idea for application
1. Change styles.css to not repeat some blocks of code. For example some styles for   tasksContainer and summaryContainer are similar, so can be grouped

2. Make application display responsive

3. Add modal to see all information about note

4. in "Dates" column detect other date formats, for instance DD.MM.YYYY. Also, add to regular expression extra checking for date format (for example day can't be 32)

5. Refactor code
